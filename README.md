### Tracking Weekly Dust Wipes at NYCHA Apartments in Power BI

Dust wipes are a required environmental test used to detect lead-contaminated dust inside apartments and are part of NYCHA’s compliance with federal lead-safety regulations issued by HUD and the EPA.

A dust wipe test uses a specialized wipe to collect dust from surfaces where lead commonly accumulates, such as floors, window sills, and window troughs. The samples are sent to a certified laboratory to measure lead levels.

NYCHA typically performs dust wipes when a child under six resides in the apartment, lead paint hazards are identified, or lead abatement or repair work has been completed.
